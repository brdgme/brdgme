# Monolith Migration Plan

## Objective

Consolidate the `brdgme` platform into a single Rust-based monolithic
application using Axum (backend) and Leptos (frontend/WASM). This replaces the
Rocket API, Node.js WebSocket service, and TypeScript/React frontend.

## Strategy

Build the new system in `rust/web` in parallel with the existing services. The
old services (`rust/api`, `web`, `websocket`) remain untouched until cutover.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Shared Logic [Complete]

**Goal:** Make `brdgme_cmd` and `brdgme_game` compatible with WASM so they can
be used in the browser frontend.

- [x] Make `warp` an optional dependency in `rust/lib/cmd/Cargo.toml`.
- [x] Gate the `http` module in `rust/lib/cmd/src/lib.rs` behind
      `#[cfg(feature = "http-server")]`.
- [x] Verify WASM compilation: `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p brdgme_cmd`.

---

## Phase 2: Database Layer [Complete]

**Goal:** Establish an async data layer using SQLx, replacing Diesel.

- [x] Add `sqlx` to `rust/web/Cargo.toml` (postgres, runtime-tokio, uuid, chrono).
- [x] Create `rust/web/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` as a baseline snapshot
      of the full existing schema. SQLx manages all future changes from this
      point.
- [x] Implement `rust/web/src/db.rs` with basic user and session queries.

**Notes:**
- Applied baseline migration to local PostgreSQL dev instance via `sqlx-cli`.
- Added `reqwest` (rustls) and `sqlx-cli` to `devenv.nix`.
- Configured `DATABASE_URL` in `devenv.nix`.

---

## Phase 3: Backend (Axum Core) [Complete]

**Goal:** Replicate auth and game orchestration logic in Axum.

Note: play-by-email is out of scope for this migration.

- [x] Implement auth routes in `rust/web/src/auth/` (login, register, logout)
      using `tower-sessions`.
- [x] Implement `rust/web/src/game/client.rs`: async HTTP client for
      communicating with external game microservices using the JSON contract.
- [x] Write a unit test mocking a game service response to verify contract
      serialization (`test_game_client_contract`).
- [x] Implement game API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/game/new`
  - `GET /api/game/{id}`
  - `POST /api/game/{id}/command`

**Notes:**
- Implemented `create_game_with_users`, `find_game_extended`, and
  `update_game_command_success` in `db.rs`.
- Refactored `rust/web/src/state.rs` to a combined `AppState` (LeptosOptions +
  PgPool) shared between Axum handlers and Leptos routes.

---

## Phase 4: WebSocket Integration [Complete]

**Goal:** Internalise real-time updates, removing the Node.js/Redis dependency.

Note: the in-process broadcast used here (`tokio::sync::broadcast`) does not
support multiple replicas. NATS Core will replace it in the post-migration
infrastructure phase. See `docs/VISION.md`.

- [x] Add `/ws` route using `axum::extract::ws::WebSocketUpgrade`.
- [x] Implement `GameBroadcaster` in `rust/web/src/websocket.rs` using
      `tokio::sync::broadcast`.
- [x] Integrate broadcast calls into `create_game` and `play_command` handlers.

**Notes:**
- Added `futures-util` for async stream management.

---

## Phase 5: Frontend (Leptos UI) [Defective]

**Goal:** Build the UI in Rust, replacing React.

- [x] Build app shell and layout components.
- [x] Implement shared types and server functions.
- [x] Build `GameBoard` (ASCII-to-HTML), `GameMeta`, `GameLogs`,
      `GameCommandInput` components.
- [x] Implement client-side command parsing using `brdgme_game` compiled to
      WASM, providing real-time suggestions and validation.
- [x] Implement WebSocket client hook (`websocket_client.rs`) that triggers
      resource refetches via a global `WebSocketTrigger` context.

**Known defects (tracked in Phase 5.6):**
- Login is non-functional end-to-end: `on_email_submit` and `on_code_submit`
  in `app.rs` are not connected to the `Login` and `ConfirmLogin` server
  functions.
- Game creation and command submission are unauthenticated: Axum handlers use
  `Uuid::nil()` as the user ID.
- Turn enforcement is absent: any player can submit a command at any time.
- `GameLogs` is a stub placeholder.
- `DashboardPage` and `GamesPage` are stubs with no content.
- Autocomplete suggestions are not prefix-filtered: all alternatives show for
  every keystroke.
- Suggestions are not clickable.
- Command errors are silently discarded.

**Notes:**
- Added `cargo-leptos`, `dart-sass`, and `wasm-bindgen-cli` to `devenv.nix`.
- Pinned `wasm-bindgen` to `=0.2.108` (matches `wasm-bindgen-cli` in nixpkgs).
- Enabled `js`/`wasm_js` features for `getrandom`.
- Updated Axum routing to `{id}` syntax.

---

## Phase 5.5: Dev Environment Migration [Complete]

**Goal:** Replace the minikube-based dev environment with Kind + Cilium +
Knative, and replace skaffold with Tilt. This is a prerequisite for the
side-by-side validation phase, since the new `rust/web` service will run as a
Knative Service in production.

### Kind cluster + Cilium

- [x] Write a Kind cluster config with the default CNI disabled
      (`networking.disableDefaultCNI: true`). → `k8s/kind-config.yaml`
- [x] Install Cilium as the CNI into the Kind cluster. (manual: run
      `scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh`)
- [x] Verify pod networking and DNS work correctly.

### Knative Serving

- [x] Install Knative Serving into the Kind cluster. (manual: run
      `scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh`)
- [x] Configure Cilium as the Knative networking layer via `net-gateway-api`
      (Cilium's GatewayClass + Knative Gateway API ingress class). Setup
      automated in `scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh`.
- [x] Verify a simple Knative Service deploys and is reachable.

### k8s manifests: rust/web as a Knative Service

- [x] Replace `k8s/base/web/deployment.yaml` and `k8s/base/web/service.yaml`
      with a Knative `Service` manifest (`serving.knative.dev/v1`).
- [x] Set `minScale: 1` - the monolith must not scale to zero.
- [x] Game microservices remain as plain Deployments for now.

### Tilt

- [x] Write a `Tiltfile` covering:
  - Deploy backing services (Postgres, Redis, SMTP, game microservices)
    to the Kind cluster via `k8s/dev-without-web` kustomize path.
  - Run `cargo leptos watch` as a local process for fast iteration (default
    hybrid mode).
  - Port-forwarding for Postgres (5432) and Redis (6379).
- [x] Full-cluster mode added (`WEB_IN_CLUSTER=1`): builds `brdgme/web` and
      deploys as Knative Service via `k8s/dev` kustomize path.
- [x] **Migrate CI to GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created.
      Builds all service images and pushes to GHCR on master. `k8s/prod` image
      references updated to GHCR via kustomize `images` overlay.
- [x] Remove `skaffold.yaml` and `.travis.yml` once GitHub Actions CI is
      verified working on master.
- [x] **Local registry for Kind + Knative**: `registry:2` container +
      containerd mirror patch + `config-deployment` skip for `kind-registry:5000`
      + Tilt `default_registry`. Requires cluster recreation to take effect.

### Production builds

Production image builds and deploys are driven by GitHub Actions (see item
above). `kubectl apply -k k8s/prod` is still the deploy mechanism.

---

## Phase 5.6: Pre-Cutover Fixes [In Progress - blockers done, frontend gaps remain]

**Goal:** Resolve all blockers and close critical gaps found in the parity
review before the `leptos` branch replaces production. Full review in
`docs/REVIEW.md`.

### Blockers (must fix before cutover)

- [x] **Auth in Axum handlers** (`game/server.rs`): Replace `Uuid::nil()` in
      `create_game` and `play_command` with the authenticated user ID from the
      session.
- [x] **Login UI wired to server functions** (`app.rs`): Connect
      `on_email_submit` and `on_code_submit` to the `Login` and `ConfirmLogin`
      server functions via `Action`. Navigates to `/dashboard` on success.
      Error messages shown on failure.
- [x] **Confirmation token not exposed in response** (`auth/server.rs`): Token
      removed from response message.
- [x] **Persistent session store** (`auth/session.rs`):
      `tower-sessions-sqlx-store 0.15.0` + `PostgresStore`, table created via
      `store.migrate()` in `create_session_layer`.
- [x] **`with_secure` env-driven** (`auth/session.rs`): Reads `SECURE_COOKIE`
      env var (`"true"` = secure).
- [x] **Graceful SIGTERM shutdown** (`main.rs`): Added `shutdown_signal()`
      listening for SIGTERM and Ctrl+C.
- [x] **Turn enforcement** (`game/server.rs`): Rejects commands when
      `!player.game_player.is_turn`.
- [x] **Authenticate `GET /api/game/{id}`** (`game/server.rs`): Returns 401
      when no valid session.
- [x] **`GamePlayer` model missing fields** (`models/game.rs`): Added
      `last_turn_at`, `is_eliminated`, `is_read`, `points`, `undo_game_state`,
      `rating_change`. Migration `002_game_player_fields.sql` applied.
- [x] **`update_game_command_success` writes all fields** (`db.rs`): Persists
      `is_turn_at`, `last_turn_at`, `is_eliminated`, `undo_game_state`, `points`,
      and `finished_at` on every command.
- [x] **`find_game_extended` handles missing `game_type_users` row** (`db.rs`):
      Returns default `GameTypeUser` with rating 1500 instead of erroring.
- [x] **Token expiry check in `validate_session_token`** (`auth/session.rs`):
      SQL query updated to `AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'`.
      SQLx offline metadata regenerated.
- [x] **Email sending** (`auth/server.rs`): `send_login_email` implemented
      using `lettre 0.11` with `AsyncSmtpTransport` (plain SMTP, no TLS).
      Reads `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` (default 25), `SMTP_FROM` from env.
      Logs warning with token if `SMTP_HOST` unset (dev fallback).

### Missing endpoints (non-blocking, needed for feature parity)

- [x] **`POST /game/{id}/undo`**: Restore `undo_game_state`, call `Status` on
      the game service, clear all players' undo state, write a log entry,
      broadcast.
- [x] **`POST /game/{id}/mark_read`**: Set `is_read = true` on the calling
      player's `game_players` row.
- [x] **`POST /game/{id}/concede`**: Limited to 2-player games. Mark game
      finished, write log entry, broadcast.
- [x] **`POST /game/{id}/restart`**: Create new game with same players, link
      via `restarted_game_id`, broadcast `GameRestarted`. Client must navigate
      to the new game URL on receipt.

### Operator (`rust/operator`) [Complete]

- [x] **`GameVersion` CRD** (`k8s/base/operator/crd.yaml`): Namespaced CRD
      with `typeName`, `playerCounts`, `weight`, `isDeprecated` fields.
- [x] **kube-rs operator**: Reconciles `GameVersion` CRs by upserting
      `game_types` and `game_versions` rows in PostgreSQL. Finalizer ensures
      `is_public = false` is written before CR deletion.
- [x] **`is_deprecated` support**: `lost-cities-1` CR has `isDeprecated: true`
      - kept running for in-progress games, excluded from new game creation.
- [x] **Migration 003**: Unique constraints on `game_types(name)` and
      `game_versions(game_type_id, name)` enabling `ON CONFLICT` upserts.
- [x] **20 `GameVersion` CR files** colocated with each game in
      `k8s/base/game/{name}/game-version.yaml`.
- [x] **Tilt integration**: `crd-ready` resource gates operator startup on CRD
      establishment; operator runs as `local_resource` with `RUST_LOG=info`.
- [x] **mirrord**: Added to `devenv.nix`; Tiltfile wraps `cargo leptos watch`
      with `mirrord exec --target pod/postgres-0 --target-namespace brdgme`
      so the local web server resolves `*.svc.cluster.local` without application
      changes or `/etc/hosts` modification.

### Frontend gaps (non-blocking)

- [x] **New-game creation UI** (`app.rs`, `GamesPage`): Game type selector,
      optional version selector, player count selector, opponent email inputs,
      submit → redirect to new game.
- [ ] **Game log rendering** (`components/game.rs`): Replace `GameLogs` stub
      with actual log display: fetch logs, render markup to HTML, group by
      10-minute windows, filter to logs since `last_turn_at`.
- [ ] **Undo/concede/restart actions in `GameMeta`**: Wire the "Concede" anchor
      and add "Undo" and "Restart" links with correct visibility conditions
      (`can_undo`, game finished, `restarted_game_id` absent).
- [ ] **"Whose turn" display** (`app.rs`): Replace generic "Waiting on
      opponents..." with the specific player name(s) and color.
- [ ] **Mark-read on game page load** (`app.rs`): Call `mark_read` when
      `GamePage` mounts and when the game ID changes.
- [ ] **`GameRestarted` WebSocket navigation** (`websocket_client.rs`): On
      receipt of `GameRestarted`, navigate to the new game URL rather than
      just incrementing the trigger counter.
- [ ] **Command input: clear after server confirms** (`components/game.rs`):
      Move `set_command("")` to run after `submit_action` succeeds, not before.
- [ ] **Command errors surfaced to user** (`components/game.rs`): Observe
      `submit_action` result and display errors.
- [ ] **Clickable command suggestions** (`components/game.rs`): Clicking a
      suggestion appends it to the command input.
- [ ] **Autocomplete prefix filtering** (`rust/lib/game`): Add
      `CommandSpec::suggest(input, names) -> Vec<String>` with prefix-aware
      `Token` filtering. Do not change `parse()`. Update `GameCommandInput` to
      call `suggest` instead of using `expected` from parse errors.

### Code quality (non-blocking)

- [ ] **Dead code removed**: `New*` model structs, `chat.rs`, `friends.rs`,
      `PublicGameType` alias, `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN_KEY`, `db::AppState`.
- [ ] **`reqwest::Client` shared** (`game/client.rs`): Create once at startup,
      store in `AppState`, reuse across requests.
- [ ] **N+1 in `find_active_games_for_user`** (`db.rs`): Replace loop with a
      single joined query.
- [ ] **Duplicate command logic** (`game/server.rs` vs `server_fns.rs`):
      Consolidate into one path.
- [x] **`chrono` → `time`** (`models/`, `lib/game`, `lib/cmd`): Replaced
      `chrono::NaiveDateTime` with `time::PrimitiveDateTime` throughout all
      model structs, `brdgme_game::Log`, and `brdgme_cmd::CliLog`. Required
      because `tower-sessions-sqlx-store` enables `sqlx/time` which takes
      precedence over `sqlx/chrono` in type inference.
- [x] **Points persisted** (`db.rs`): `_points` suppression removed;
      points written per-player in `update_game_command_success`.
- [x] **Logout redirect/feedback** (`components/layout.rs`): Navigate to `/login` after logout action succeeds.
- [ ] **WebSocket reconnection** (`websocket_client.rs`).
- [x] **`finished_at` set when `is_finished = true`** (`db.rs`): Set via
      `COALESCE($arg, finished_at)` in `update_game_command_success`.

---

## Phase 6: Redis pub/sub in rust/web [Pending - HIGH PRIORITY]

**Goal:** Replace the in-process `tokio::sync::broadcast` WebSocket fan-out
with Redis pub/sub. This is a blocker for two things:

1. **Multi-replica correctness** - `tokio::sync::broadcast` is in-process only;
   a move on replica A never reaches clients connected to replica B.
2. **Side-by-side validation** - during Phase 7, both `rust/web` and the legacy
   stack share Redis. Publishing to the same `game.{id}` channels means a move
   in either system triggers a WebSocket notification for clients on the other.

Redis is already in the cluster and the legacy API already uses `game.{id}`
channel naming. NATS replaces Redis in Phase 8, after legacy decommission.

### Channel contract (matches legacy API)

The legacy API publishes to:
- `game.{game_id}` - public update, broadcast to all players watching a game
- `user.{user_auth_token_id}` - player-specific update (includes command_spec)

`rust/web` uses session cookies, not bearer tokens, so `user.*` channels are
not applicable. Publishing to `game.{id}` is sufficient for multi-replica
fanout and cross-system notifications.

The legacy websocket service forwards raw Redis messages to WebSocket clients.
`rust/web` clients treat any message on a subscribed channel as a trigger to
refetch state (they ignore message content). The legacy React frontend may not
parse `rust/web`-published messages correctly, but legacy users will see correct
state on next page load. This is acceptable for the validation period.

### Application changes (`rust/web`)

- [ ] Add `redis` to `rust/web/Cargo.toml` under the `ssr` feature (or promote
      the existing unused dependency).
- [ ] Replace `GameBroadcaster` in `websocket.rs`: publish a message to
      `game.{id}` via Redis `PUBLISH` instead of tokio broadcast.
- [ ] Subscribe each WebSocket handler to `game.{id}` via Redis `SUBSCRIBE`
      and forward messages to the connected client (trigger refetch).
- [ ] Remove `tokio::sync::broadcast` from `AppState` and `GameBroadcaster`.
- [ ] Read `REDIS_URL` env var for the Redis connection (matches legacy config).

---

## Phase 6.5: Production CD (ArgoCD) [Pending]

**Goal:** Replace manual `kubectl apply -k k8s/prod` with ArgoCD for GitOps
continuous delivery. GitHub Actions handles CI (build + push to GHCR). ArgoCD
handles CD (sync cluster state to Git). Database migrations run as an ArgoCD
PreSync hook so a failed migration halts the sync before any pods are replaced.

### ArgoCD installation (production cluster)

- [ ] Install ArgoCD into the production cluster via the official manifest:
      `kubectl apply -n argocd -f
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml`
- [ ] Expose the ArgoCD API server (LoadBalancer or Ingress).
- [ ] Store the initial admin password securely and rotate it.

### ArgoCD Application manifest

- [ ] Create `k8s/argocd/brdgme-app.yaml`: an `Application` resource pointing
      to this repo, `k8s/prod` kustomize path, auto-sync enabled, prune
      enabled, self-heal enabled.
- [ ] Commit the `Application` manifest to the repo so ArgoCD manages itself
      (app-of-apps pattern is not needed at this scale - a single Application
      is sufficient).

### Database migration PreSync hook

- [ ] Create `k8s/base/migrate/job.yaml`: a `Job` that runs
      `sqlx migrate run` using the `brdgme/web` image and the `postgres-config`
      secret. Annotate with:
      - `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync`
      - `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation`
- [ ] Add `k8s/base/migrate/` to `k8s/base/brdgme/kustomization.yaml`.
- [ ] Verify: a failed migration halts the ArgoCD sync and leaves the running
      pods untouched.

### Image update flow (separate config repo)

Image tags are tracked in a dedicated `brdgme-config` repo (separate from this
source repo). GitHub Actions pushes images to GHCR then commits the updated
tags to `brdgme-config`. ArgoCD watches `brdgme-config`, not this repo.

Rationale: committing tags back to the source repo creates CI loop risk and
mixes deployment history with code history. A separate config repo keeps
rollback simple (revert the tag commit, ArgoCD syncs) without any additional
tooling. If a more integrated official mechanism ships with ArgoCD in future it
should be evaluated then.

- [ ] Create a `brdgme-config` repository containing the `k8s/prod` kustomize
      manifests (copy from this repo). This becomes the single source of truth
      for what is running in production.
- [ ] Update the ArgoCD `Application` to point to `brdgme-config` instead of
      this repo.
- [ ] Add a GitHub Actions deploy step: after pushing images to GHCR, clone
      `brdgme-config`, run `kustomize edit set image` for each updated image,
      commit, and push. ArgoCD auto-sync picks up the change.
- [ ] Grant the GitHub Actions bot write access to `brdgme-config` via a
      deploy key or fine-grained PAT scoped to that repo only.
- [ ] To roll back: revert the relevant commit in `brdgme-config`. ArgoCD
      syncs to the previous tag. No tooling changes required.

### Notes

- Migrations are forward-only. A migration that removes a column still read
  by the running version will break live traffic. Use expand/contract: add the
  new column in one deploy, remove the old column in a later deploy after all
  pods are on the new version.
- ArgoCD does not replace Tilt for local dev. Tilt remains the dev environment
  tool; ArgoCD is production-only.

---

## Phase 7: Side-by-Side Validation [Pending]

**Goal:** Run old and new systems simultaneously against the same database so
they can be compared directly before committing to cutover. Legacy services
(`rust/api`, `web`, `websocket`) are kept alive until `rust/web` is proven in
production.

Both systems share PostgreSQL, Redis, and the game microservices. Auth
mechanisms are different (Bearer token vs session cookie) so each requires a
separate login - this is acceptable for testing. Both systems publish to Redis
`game.{id}` channels (after Phase 6), so a move in either UI triggers a
WebSocket notification for clients on the other. Legacy clients may not render
the `rust/web` message payload correctly but will see correct state on next
page load.

### Risks

- `web/Dockerfile` bumped to `node:20` (was `node:14.7.0`, EOL). Build
  verified working.

### Image naming

The old React frontend (`web/Dockerfile`) and the new Leptos SSR app
(`rust/Dockerfile` `web` target) previously shared the image tag `brdgme/web`.
The new Leptos app keeps `brdgme/web`. The old React frontend is renamed to
`brdgme/web-legacy`.

### Infra changes needed

- [x] New Leptos app: `rust/Dockerfile` `web` target → `brdgme/web`. k8s
      manifests in `k8s/base/web/` unchanged.
- [x] Add `brdgme/web-legacy` image build to the Tiltfile (from
      `web/Dockerfile`, final stage `web`, tagged `brdgme/web-legacy`).
- [x] Add `brdgme/api` and `brdgme/websocket` image builds to the Tiltfile.
- [ ] Create `k8s/base/web-legacy/` manifests (Deployment + Service) using
      `image: brdgme/web-legacy`. Mirror the structure of `k8s/base/web/` but
      with `name: web-legacy`.
- [ ] Create `k8s/base/legacy/kustomization.yaml` grouping `web-legacy`, `api`,
      and `websocket` as the legacy stack.
- [ ] Restore `api` and `websocket` manifests to an active kustomization overlay
      alongside the legacy frontend.
- [ ] Configure Knative domain to `brdg.me` (patch `config-domain` in
      `knative-serving`).
- [ ] Create Knative `DomainMapping` resources (one per service) to assign
      custom hostnames. All services are already Knative Services, so Kourier
      routes by hostname automatically:
      - `brdg.me` → `web`
      - `legacy.brdg.me` → `web-legacy`
      - `api.brdg.me` → `api`
      - `ws.brdg.me` → `websocket`
- [ ] Remove `k8s/base/ingress/` (nginx Ingress) - Kourier becomes the sole
      external entry point once DomainMappings are in place.
- [ ] TLS: cert-manager with certificates on each DomainMapping (Knative
      `CertificateClass` annotation), or a wildcard `*.brdg.me` cert.
- [ ] Verify the old React frontend's API base URL is configured to point to
      the `api` service, not `web`.

### Decommission (once rust/web is proven in production)

When the new system has run in production without issues, remove the legacy
stack in this order:

- [ ] Remove `api`, `websocket`, and `web-legacy` from the kustomization and
      delete their k8s manifests.
- [ ] Delete `rust/api/`, `web/`, and `websocket/` source directories.
- [ ] Remove legacy image builds from the Tiltfile.

Redis remains after this step - it is still used by `rust/web`. Removal
happens in Phase 8.

**Notes (Build & Dev Environment):**
- Switched to `cargo-binstall` in Dockerfile to avoid `serde` compilation
  errors when installing `cargo-leptos`.
- Fixed `dart-sass` path handling in Dockerfile.
- Isolated `cargo chef cook` for the `web` crate to prevent non-WASM
  dependencies (`mio`, `socket2`) from breaking the WASM build graph.
- Implemented `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` support via `.sqlx` metadata. Added
  Skaffold port-forwarding to allow local builds to verify queries against
  the K8s Postgres instance.
- Refactored `skaffold.yaml`: default profile deploys only backing services
  (Postgres, Redis, game services), skipping the slow `web` build. Use
  `skaffold dev -p with-web` for a full cluster test.

**2025-12-22: Fixed database connection pool in server functions**
- Server functions were failing with "Database pool not found" errors.
- Root cause: `leptos_axum::extract()` with `State<AppState>` had no state
  context in the server function scope.
- Fix: switched to Leptos context-based dependency injection.
  - `leptos_routes_with_context()` instead of `leptos_routes()`.
  - `PgPool` and `GameBroadcaster` provided via `provide_context()`.
  - Server functions use `use_context::<PgPool>()` instead of Axum state
    extraction.
  - `use_context()` with error handling instead of `expect_context()`.

---

## Phase 8: NATS Migration [Pending]

**Goal:** Replace Redis pub/sub with NATS Core, then remove Redis entirely.
This phase runs after legacy decommission so there are no cross-system
compatibility concerns.

- [ ] Add NATS Core to the Kind cluster dev environment (Tiltfile + k8s
      manifests in `k8s/base/nats/`).
- [ ] Add NATS to `k8s/base/brdgme/kustomization.yaml`.
- [ ] Replace Redis `PUBLISH`/`SUBSCRIBE` in `rust/web/src/websocket.rs` with
      `async-nats` publish/subscribe on the same `game.{id}` subject naming.
- [ ] Remove the `redis` dependency from `rust/web/Cargo.toml`.
- [ ] Remove Redis from `k8s/base/brdgme/kustomization.yaml` and delete
      `k8s/base/redis/`.
- [ ] Remove Redis port-forward from the Tiltfile.

**Note:** NATS Core → JetStream upgrade path (persistent delivery) requires
only a config flag change and a volume. No code change needed.

## Development Workflow

Requires a Kind cluster with Knative (Kourier ingress). Run once per workstation:

```
bash scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh
```

### Hybrid (Fast Iteration) - default

```
tilt up
```

Deploys backing services (Postgres, Redis, SMTP, game microservices, operator)
to Kind. Runs `cargo leptos watch` locally via mirrord so the web server can
resolve cluster-internal DNS (`*.brdgme.svc.cluster.local`) without any
application changes. Hot-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: in this mode there is no `web` Knative Service in the cluster, so
`web.brdgme.lvh.me:8080` is not available. Use `localhost:3000` instead.

### Full Cluster Test

```
WEB_IN_CLUSTER=1 tilt up
```

Builds and deploys `brdgme/web` as a Knative Service into Kind alongside all
backing services.
