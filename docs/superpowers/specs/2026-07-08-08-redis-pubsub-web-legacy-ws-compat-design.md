**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Replace the in-process `tokio::sync::broadcast` WebSocket fan-out
with Redis pub/sub, and publish legacy-compatible payloads so `web-legacy`
React clients receive correct real-time updates without re-engineering.

## Web-legacy WS compatibility (fat payload publishing)

The legacy API publishes to:
- `game.{game_id}` - public ShowResponse, broadcast to all watching a game
- `user.{user_auth_token_id}` - private ShowResponse with `command_spec`

The `user.{token_id}` channel is non-negotiable for web-legacy compat. The
React reducer (`web/src/reducers/game.ts` line 26-28) explicitly skips public
channel updates when the user already has a private game view loaded
(`existing.game_player && !g.game_player` → return). Without private per-player
messages, React users on the game page would never see cross-system moves.

`rust/web` now publishes the same legacy-format JSON to both channels on every
game event. The legacy React reducer reads `game`, `game_type`, `game_version`,
`game_players`, `game_logs`, `html`, `game_player`, `command_spec` - all
populated correctly. Web-legacy clients receive full real-time updates from
either system during Phase 16 side-by-side operation.

## Leptos-specific WS channel (eliminates re-fetch)

`rust/web` also publishes `BrdgmeUpdate` (a `GameViewData` + `Vec<GameLogEntry>`
struct) to `ws.{user_id}` per player. The `/ws` handler is session-aware:
subscribes to both `game.*` and `ws.{user_id}`. The Leptos client handles
`BrdgmeUpdate` by setting a context signal directly - no server function
re-fetch needed for game state or logs. `active_games` sidebar still re-fetches
(cheap DB-only query) via `last_update` increment.
