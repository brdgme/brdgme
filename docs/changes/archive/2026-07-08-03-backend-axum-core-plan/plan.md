# 3: Backend (Axum Core) - Implementation Plan (historical)

> Extracted 2026-07-08 from `docs/plan/03-backend-axum-core.md`. This work is

**Status:** Complete

**Goal:** Replicate auth and game orchestration logic in Axum.

Note: play-by-email is out of scope for this migration.

- [x] Implement auth routes in `rust/web/src/auth/` (login, register, logout)
      using `tower-sessions`.
- [x] Implement `rust/web/src/game/client.rs`: async HTTP client for
      communicating with external game microservices using the JSON contract.
- [x] Write a unit test mocking a game service response to verify contract
      serialization (`test_game_client_contract`).
- [x] Implement game API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/game/new`
  - `GET /api/game/{id}`
  - `POST /api/game/{id}/command`

**Notes:**
- Implemented `create_game_with_users`, `find_game_extended`, and
  `update_game_command_success` in `db.rs`.
- Refactored `rust/web/src/state.rs` to a combined `AppState` (LeptosOptions +
  PgPool) shared between Axum handlers and Leptos routes.
