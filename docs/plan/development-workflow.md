# Development Workflow

**Status:** Reference (no phase status; ongoing process doc)

Requires a Kind cluster with Knative (Kourier ingress). Run once per workstation:

```
bash scripts/setup-kind-cluster.sh
```

### Hybrid (Fast Iteration) - default

```
tilt up
```

Deploys backing services (Postgres, Redis, SMTP, game microservices, operator)
to Kind. Runs `cargo leptos watch` locally via mirrord so the web server can
resolve cluster-internal DNS (`*.brdgme.svc.cluster.local`) without any
application changes. Hot-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: in this mode there is no `web` Knative Service in the cluster, so
`web.brdgme.lvh.me:8080` is not available. Use `localhost:3000` instead.

### Full Cluster Test

```
WEB_IN_CLUSTER=1 tilt up
```

Builds and deploys `brdgme/web` as a Knative Service into Kind alongside all
backing services.
