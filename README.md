**brdgme** is entirely [**free and open-source software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

**brdgme** development and the service provided is driven by the following core
philosophies:

* **Play-by-email, not notify-by-email** - all games can be played only using
  email, the server can process commands from email replies.
* **Corporate / school network friendly** - the system is geared towards being
  usable inside strict overbearing networks, if can send and receive emails you
  can play.
* **ASCII graphics, focus on readability and usability** - all game renders are
  ASCII text with coloring and basic text decoration.
* **Basic text commands** - all game plays are made with simple text commands
  like `play a4` and `buy 3 sackson`, making pure play-by-email and bot creation
  incredibly simple.
* **Strong bot support, and community developed bots** - games will only go live
  in **brdgme** if they have at least a basic official bot implemented, and
  community members can submit their own bots to play again humans and other
  bots.
